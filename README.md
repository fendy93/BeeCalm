# Overview
BeeCalm is an Android mobile and watch app and filled with resources for people suffering from panic attacks. The app consist of feature documentation on each resource and more in-depth instructions on how to use each one and why each is effective. In addition, it will also include more general anxiety-combatting information, not only just a symptom but also an attempt to help the root of the problem.

# Problem and Solution Overview
Anxiety disorders are the most common mental illness in the U.S., affecting 40 million adults in the United States ages 18 and older, or 18% of the population (Source: National Institute of Mental Health). Our Android mobile and watch application aims to help people experiencing a panic attack to calm their mind and body and overcome it. When someone is suffering from a panic attack, they are filled with adrenaline coupled wih a sense of dread, making it hard to think clearly and rationally, which can greatly affect their daily life. Our app will help the user get through a panic attack in three main ways:

1. Help the person disconnect from their panic-inducing situation by guiding him or her to repeat a simple, physically-focused task.

2. Help the person feel physically relaxed through the use of tapping points, yoga, or breathing exercises.

3. Help the person feel mentally calm through the use of mantras and audio. 

# Features
1. Get breathing under control -- this is the easiest way to help calm down from an adrenaline rush.  As the second user put it, “It is impossible to be both physically relaxed and physically anxious at the same time.”  We were thinking of having a clock that ticked out the number of seconds to breathe in and breathe out, but the second user also suggested a timed animation of a balloon inflating and deflating to give a more compelling visual experience.
2. Mantras -- mantras are a great way to interrupt the out-of-control negative stream of consciousness that can overtake a panicked person’s thoughts. The third user repeats generic ones that work for all panic attacks, but the second user also suggested allowing a user to add their own. He specifically would want to add ones that had to do with flying--“Flying is safer than driving” for example.  We could easily have watch screens with mantras on them and the option to customize more on the mobile.
3. Tapping/Other Physical Stimulation -- The first two users use tapping to focus on a rhythm rather than their thoughts and the last user described how helpful it was to have a loved one just rub her back or stroke her hair as she tried to calm down. If we could make the watch vibrate in a repeated rhythm or provide an interface for tapping, that could be really helpful.
4. Calming sounds -- both the second and third user mentioned how it would be nice to have an option to listen to soothing audio, similar to a baby’s white noise machine. The sound of waves, heart beats, wind through the trees, a stream, etc. would help the user detach from the anxiety-provoking setting that they’re in and recenter themselves.  We can provide this in its own watch screen or we could even have an option to overlay it on the breathing application
5. Call List -- the first user needed to contact a specific set of people when she was feeling panicked.  We could offer the option on the mobile for a user to add contacts to a list that would appear on the watch.  A tap of the contact would begin a phone call to them.  Users could add their loved ones or even their therapist’s office.
